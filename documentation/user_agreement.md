# Gearbox Makerspace User Agreement
## open hours: m - f 09h00 - 16h45
 
## rules and regulations 
* Users must be current students at the McGill Department of Physics.
* Users must complete the appropriate 3D printer orientation session before using
the 3D printers. Special permission is required to use the Formlabs Form 2 SLA printer.
Contact one of the people listed below.
* For the time being, 3-D printing can only be done using PLA filament.
* Students must not use any equipment for which they have not received training from a qualified instructor.
* After completing training and signing the User Agreement, users will receive an
individual account to use the Repetier print server. Users must only print using their own
credentials and not share their credentials with anyone else.
* Nothing may be printed that is not appropriate for a university setting or violates
McGill's code of conduct.
* Users agree to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to the use of the 
3D printer, including copyright and patent infringement regulations.
* Users are responsible for equipment in the room while they are the ones actively logged in.
* No tools, equipment, supplies, materials belonging to the makerspace may be taken out of the room.
* Students agree not to change default settings or paramters on the equipment. If in doubt about a parameter or setting, consider it default and do not change it. Contact the TA or Robert Turner for help.
* Students trained in using the 3-D printers will have card key access to the makerspace during Open Hours, and are only allowed into the makerspace at those times. Access is granted to a user upon swiping their McGill identification card over the card reader next to the door.
* After Hours access (M-F 16h45 - 21h00) is availble on an individual basis to students who actively support the Gearbox community.
After Hours access can also be granted for a limited time to individuals for demonstrated research project needs.
Anyone accessing the makerspace After Hours must individually swipe their pass cards upon entering the space.
After Hours users are not permitted to let anyone enter the room who does not swipe their own access card over the reader.
* The door to the makerspace must remain closed After Hours, except to allow access to the room.
If the door is held open, a silent alarm will summon security personnel.

## printing etiquette
* Users are responsible for leaving the equipment in at least the same condition as when
they found it. Please clean up after yourself and others. We aim to maintain an open space for members of the McGill Physics Department to explore their creativity.
* Users agree that if the equipment becomes damaged, defective, or unsafe, they will
immediately contact both of the first two personnel to inform them. They should also leave a clear note explaining the issue on or next to the piece of equipment in question.
* Print jobs taking up to 6 hours long can be printed on first come, first serve
basis.
* Long jobs (lasting more than 6 hours) should only be completed on the
long job printer, overnight, or on the weekends. If you have questions concerning long print jobs, contact either of the first two personnel.

## contact personnel
* In case of need, contact either:
1. the current TA, whose coordinates will be posted in the makerspace, 
2. Robert Turner <robert.turner@mcgill.ca>, Wong 0121, x6356, or
3. Thomas Brunner <thomas.brunner@mcgill.ca>.
