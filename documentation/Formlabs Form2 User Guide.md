# Formlabs Instructions

## Design Preparation
- Export the design into an STL file.
- Load the STL file into the Preform software and select the desired resin and resolution for the print.
- In general it is advised to use the automatic layout and support function of Preform, however, if this will not work for your application, then set the layout and supports manually. 
- If there are no warnings generated for your print then save the form file.



## Loading the Job to printer
- The form file can be transferred to the printer either through direct USB connection or by connecting to the printer via the internet.


## Setting Up Printer For Print
- Load a print tray into the printer, if a previously used tray is being used do not remove cover before loading to avoid accidental spilling.
- Attach the squeegee to the squeegee attachment, make sure this is properly clipped in and is secure.
- Wipe off a build platform with IPA, then slide and lock it into place in the printer.
- Shake resin cartridge for 1 minute and then load it into back of printer, if orange cap is on valve then remove this first.
- Open top cap on cartridge to allow resin to flow.

## Start Print
- On the printer's LCD screen, find the uploaded job and select it for print.
- Follow instructions on screen to verify that everything is setup correctly.
- Please supervise the first layer of print to insure that everything is functioning as it should.
- If squeegee is colliding with build platform then stop the print and make sure squeegee is properly secured.
- Mention "Peel" part of cycle

## Removing Print and Clearing Printer
- Once print is complete, remove the build platform from the printer.
- Use KimWipe underneath the build platform to avoid resin from dripping on printer and workspace.
- Load the build platform into the Form Wash Station and set for a 10-20 minute wash.
- On the printer, detach the squeegee but do not lift it out of the tray.
- Cover tray with cling wrap or another appropriate cover to avoid spills.
- Carefully remove the tray from the printer to avoid resin dripping on optical window.
- Close resin cap and pull out resin cartridge, reattach orange cap on valve if available.
- Store tray and Cartridge in cabinet.

## Removing Print from Platform and Curing
- Once the IPA wash is complete, use the spatula to remove the pieces from the build platform.
- Slide the spatula under the print and lever up until part pops off.
- Be careful, part can go flying.
- Wipe down build platform and put back in its proper location.
- Once the parts have dried for 30 minutes after the wash then they can be loaded in the Form Cure Station and cured for 20-60 minutes depending on the size of the part.
